This is an example comment which would generally be in a mercurial commit
as you can see there are newlines used to break long lines but we in fact 
want the lines followed by new lines which are not empty to be considered 
as a whole line when commiting to bugzilla and allow bugzilla to do the 
formatting as it wishes.

Anything followed by an empty new line should actually be considered as a newline

- This is a point
- This is a second point
